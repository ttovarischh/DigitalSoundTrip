            This synthesizer is my reflection on our current reality. Over the
            past six months, most of my friends have moved to other countries.
            We can only communicate via zoom or telegram. Thatâ€™s sad indeed.
            <br></br><br></br>
            However, the difference in our audio backgrounds creates a kind of
            music. I can hear birds from one friend and sea from the other. This
            synthesizer consists of one drum sequence, 9 samplers and 3 synthes.
            It uses all those special and new (at least for me) sounds of
            Georgia, Armenia and Israel.
